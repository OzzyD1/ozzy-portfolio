    overview: `
        <p><em>A Day in the Life of Andrew</em> is a nine-minute comedic short made by a team of four. I supervised and refined the script, directed the team and handled all post-production, including editing and visual effects.</p>
        <p>I didn’t operate the camera but guided the overall direction and tone to get the right pacing and comedic rhythm. The humour relied heavily on <strong>precise editing</strong> and <strong>After Effects compositing</strong> like rotoscoping and timing cuts for punchlines.</p>
        <p>The result is a light-hearted short that mixes technical polish with personality and humour, a project that reminded me how much emotion and timing shape audience connection even in comedy.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Creative Approach</h3>
    <p>
        A few scripted scenes couldn’t be filmed due to time constraints. To keep the humour intact, I filled those gaps with stock footage, which ended up making the jokes land even better. It turned a limitation into one of the funniest parts of the film.
    </p>
    <p>
        My focus was on performance rhythm and editing flow, keeping the film visually dynamic and emotionally engaging while letting timing and contrast drive the comedy.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        This project taught me how much tone and timing define emotion in storytelling. It showed me that creative problem-solving, even when using stock footage, can make a project more memorable than planned.

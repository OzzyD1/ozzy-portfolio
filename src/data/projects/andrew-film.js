    overview: `
    <p><em>A Day in the Life of Andrew</em> is a nine-minute comedic short made by a team of four as part of a college assignment. I helped shape the story, directed performances, and handled all post-production, including editing and visual effects.</p>
    <p>The production faced a few challenges, tight deadlines, scheduling conflicts and even a team member leaving midway, but we managed to pull through and deliver one of the strongest submissions in the class. I kept the humour fast-paced and playful, using creative editing tricks and over-the-top cuts to keep the audience entertained.</p>
    <p>While I didn’t film the scenes myself, I focused on rhythm, tone and pacing to keep the comedy consistent throughout. The project reminded me how much fun it can be to take limitations and turn them into something that feels lively and full of character.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Creative Approach</h3>
    <p>
      The biggest challenge was time — balancing schedules between four people while keeping to the assignment deadline. 
      When some footage couldn’t be shot, I used stock clips and editing tricks to fill the gaps and keep the story moving. 
      I also leaned into intentionally cheesy transitions and sound effects, knowing the audience would be other video students who’d appreciate the humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every decision was about keeping energy high and making the film feel cohesive despite the chaos behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This project taught me how to adapt quickly, work through unpredictable team dynamics and still deliver something that connects. 
      It reminded me that creativity isn’t just about the plan, it’s about how you recover when the plan falls apart.

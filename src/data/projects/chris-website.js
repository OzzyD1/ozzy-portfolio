    overview: `
        <p>A modern portfolio website for a freelance photographer, built with performance and user experience in mind. The site features a <strong>custom image gallery</strong> with lazy loading and a headless CMS for easy content management.</p>
        <p>Working closely with Chris, I created a clean, minimal design that lets his photography take center stage while providing all the functionality he needed to manage his portfolio independently.</p>
        <p>The project emphasized <em>performance optimization</em> and <em>mobile responsiveness</em> to ensure his work looks stunning on any device.</p>

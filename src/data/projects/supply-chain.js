    overview: `
    <p><em>Moving Parts</em> is a corporate explainer video I produced during my time at KOSTAL, an international automotive company. The project aimed to visualise how global disruptions, such as extreme weather, piracy and the Suez Canal blockage can affect the delivery of parts from Asia to Ireland.</p>
    <p>I designed, animated and narrated the piece myself, using <strong>After Effects</strong> to bring the logistics journey to life through a branded world map. The video highlighted real risks to production and explained how delays cascade through the supply chain.</p>
    <p>The result was an engaging internal communication tool that combined research, storytelling and design to help teams better understand the realities of global logistics.</p>

    <ul class="space-y-3">
      <li>• Visualise how international supply routes impact timelines and cost</li>
      <li>• Communicate risks caused by real-world events in a clear, visual way</li>

      <li>• Strengthen cross-department awareness through accessible storytelling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Research and Development</h3>
    <p>
      I spent several weeks researching global shipping routes and common risk factors. 
      This included studying real piracy data, reviewing weather disruption reports and interviewing logistics staff at KOSTAL to ensure accuracy. 
      The script was built around these insights to explain how each factor could affect travel time and costs.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Design and Production</h3>
    <p>
      Using <strong>After Effects</strong> and <strong>Illustrator</strong>, I created a stylised world map coloured to match corporate branding. 
      I animated trade routes, aircraft paths and regional highlights to show the journey from Asia to Ireland. 
      I also composited news headlines, storm visuals and piracy incidents to ground the story in real-world context. 
      The final narration was recorded and mixed by me to maintain a cohesive tone throughout.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This was my final project before returning to college and one of the most ambitious videos I produced. 
      It required extensive research, technical layering and clear communication to turn a complex topic into something people could easily follow. 
      I was proud of how it balanced factual accuracy with visual storytelling, showing that even corporate content can have style and emotion.

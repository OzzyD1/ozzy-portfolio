    description: "SOUND DESIGN | MIXING | VOICE OVER",
    overview: `
    <p>This collection covers my audio work — from sound design and mixing to the occasional music production project. 
    I’m not a full-time musician, but I’ve developed a strong technical understanding of sound and how it can shape emotion and rhythm in any medium.</p>
    <p>I enjoy crafting soundscapes that complement visuals, writing scripts for voice-over projects, and fine-tuning mixes until they feel balanced and alive. 
    One of my voice-over projects was shortlisted as a finalist for the <strong>TFI Smarter Travel Awards</strong>, which was a proud moment for me.</p>
    <p>My focus is always on clarity and tone — making audio that enhances the story rather than distracts from it. 
    I’ve also produced mashups, ambient pieces, and short musical ideas simply for the fun of experimenting with sound.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Creative Approach</h3>
    <p>
      I see audio as the emotional glue of any project. Whether it’s subtle UI feedback, ambient sound for a film, or a short music cue, 
      I try to make every sound purposeful. Having a good ear helps me bridge sound and visuals — finding harmony between what’s seen and what’s felt.
